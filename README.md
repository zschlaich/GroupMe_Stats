### GROUPME STATS PARSER
## Background
The goal of this project is to take information from a specific group, and determine different user-related statistics within that group. For example:
<li>How many messages have been sent by this user?</li>
<li>How many likes has this user's messages received?</li>
<li>How many messages has this user liked?</li>
<br>
As development continues, more potential statistics will be determined. This information will be gathered using the GroupMe API.
